# Pokedex
> In order to demonstrate the uses of Styled Components in an application built with React JS, I designed an interface that mimics the very first Pokedex that Professor Oak gave to Ash Ketchum before his epic journey with Pikachu.  It turns on when you press the OFF button, showing how you can change the style of components based on props.  The data is taken from a [Pokemon GraphQL API by lucasbento](https://github.com/lucasbento/graphql-pokemon).
